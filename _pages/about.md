Short Bio
=====
I am a PhD student based in the Energy and Environment Institute (EEI) and department of Biological and Marine Sciences (BMS) at The University of Hull. I am working with Dr Katharina Wollenberg Valero investigating genomic markers predicting lizard response to climate change. I previously completed an undergraduate Masterâ€™s degree studying species delimitation and phylogenetics at Bangor University. I am a keen herpetologist, and find them a fascinating group to ask novel ecological and evolutionary questions. I have been involved with several conservation-based expeditions around the world including king cobra spatial ecology in Thailand and snakebite research in Northwest India.

Interests
======
I largely focus on herpetology as a study system to ask interesting ecological and evolutionary questions. I particularly like using these biological disciplines in the context of informing conservation measures and protecting, preserving, or creating, biodiversity.
